                         <small>Does consolidating local governments while expanding their autonomy improve governance and development? I study Ukraineâ€™s 2015-2020 reform, which allowed small local councils to voluntarily amalgamate into newly created <i>hromadas</i> with greater fiscal and administrative authority. Councils that were wealthier, more Ukrainian-speaking and more similar to their neighbors were more likely to merge. Amalgamation improved procurement performance, strengthened fiscal capacity and increased local economic activity. Survey evidence further shows that residents of rural areas, who were most exposed to the reform, were more likely to identify solely as Ukrainian. The gains were particularly pronounced for smaller hromadas and for peripheral local councils within merged units, as well as in places with greater baseline financial capacity. Together, these findings suggest that consolidating jurisdictions while devolving authority can enhance state effectiveness, stimulate local development and shape civic identity.
